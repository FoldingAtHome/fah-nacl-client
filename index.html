      <p>
        The progress bar shows an estimate of how long the current task should
        take.  The text directly below the progress bar tells you what task
        the client is currently working on.  Typical tasks are downloading,
        waiting, running a simulation or sending back results.

    <div title="What's the Project Box?" id="project-box-dialog">
      <p>
        Scientists submit simulation projects to Folding@home.
        The project box displays information about the simulation project
        currently running on your computer.  It tells you information about
        the science, the type of disease being targeted and the person
        or persons responsible for the research.

    </div>

    <div title="What's Folding Power?" id="folding-power-dialog">
      <center><img src="images/folding-power.png"/></center>
      <p>
        Folding power controls how much of your computer's resources
        Folding@home uses.  If you want to see what your high performance
        system can do crank it up to <em>Full</em>.  If your computer
        starts to stress out move it to <em>Light</em> to give it a
        break.
      </p>

      <p>These settings have the following meaning:</p>
      <table>
        <tr><th>Light</th><td>20%</td></tr>
        <tr><th>Medium</th><td>60%</td></tr>
        <tr><th>Full</th><td>100%</td></tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        Actual usage will be less than these values and depends on how many
        CPU cores your system has available and what other processes are
        running on your computer at the time.

      <p>Scientists around the world
        utilize your donated computer time to better understand and develop
        cures for some of humanity's worst diseases. Simply by running
        Folding@home software you are aiding research for Alzheimer's,
        Huntington's, and many cancers.</p>

      <p>People like you, from all over the globe, currently
        donate the unused power of over a quarter of a million computers,
        forming the world's most powerful distributed super-computer.</p>

      <h4>The Science</h4>
      <p>Proteins help fight disease by first assembling themselves or
        "folding". When proteins misfold, there can be serious health
        consequences.</p>
      <p>If we better understand protein misfolding we can design drugs and
        therapies to combat these illnesses.</p>
      <p>See our <a href="https://foldingathome.org/science/"
                    >Folding Science page</a> and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding"
           >Protein Folding Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

      <h4>The Software</h4>
      <p>Folding@home software aids research by simulating protein folding.
        The calculations are immense so we break them into small "work units"
        and pass them to individual computers like yours to solve.</p>
      <p>Folding@home.org computers assemble data from thousands of work units into
        meaningful answers to important scientific questions.</p>
      <p>See the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding@home"
                    >Folding@home Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

      <h4>Get Involved</h4>
      <p>One of the best ways to help Folding@home is by recruiting your
        friends and family. Start by sharing our project with them.</p>
      <p>Then <a href="https://stats.foldingathome.org/teams"
                 >join a team</a> or even
        <a href="https://apps.foldingathome.org/team/new"
           >start your own team</a>. The more points you and your team earn, the
        closer we come to finding cures.</p>
      <p>Our non-profit organization also accepts
        <a href="https://foldingathome.org/donate">donations</a>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div title="Fold with a team" id="team-dialog">
      <p>Join a folding team and compete against other teams for points.</p>

      <p>If you have joined a team you should enter your team number above.
        Then the points you earn to be added to your team's total.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://stats.foldingathome.org/teams"
               >Team Stats Page</a>.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div title="Lock in your identity" id="passkey-dialog">
      <p>A passkey is a unique identifier which you can use to track your
        individual points.  It will also allow you to earn bonus points.
      </p>

      <p>Folding@home allows anyone to use any valid name to identify
        themselves. This means that if you choose a common name there are
        likely other people using it as well.</p>

        <li>Have you enabled NaCl?
          <p>Currently you must enable Native Client manually by typing
            <tt>chrome://flags/#enable-nacl</tt> into the Chrome address bar
            and clicking <b>Enable</b>.  If it says <b>Disable</b> that means
            Native Client is already enabled.</p>
        </li>

        <li>Is NaCl debugging <em>disabled</em>?
          <p>Native Client debugging is disabled by default but if it is enabled
            it will inhibit our software from running.  To ensure debugging is
            disabled, type <tt>chrome://flags/#enable-nacl-debug</tt> into the
            Chrome address bar check the setting.</p>
        </li>

            <b>Quit</b> from your browser menu and start again.</p>
        </li>
